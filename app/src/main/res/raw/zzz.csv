Title 1/Same thing just happened to me. I was doing work just fine, and then I couldn't type at all in the Editor window or Apple + F2 to kill modules (or Ctrl + Option + D to restart debug on running modules). Had to restart the IDE, which sucks because I run modules in it which can mess up resources if they're not properly terminated./Author/Data
